Base of binarynumber system is 2, for any multi-bit binary number, one or more than one bit changes in two successive numbers.In graycode, only one bit changes
at a time in two successive gray codes   

Note:Gray codes are used in the multiple clock domain designs to transfer the control information from one of the clock domains to another clock domain. 
Note: Gray codes are used in the gray counter implementation and in the error correcting mechanism.
