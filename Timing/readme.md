clock skew: systematic clock edge varaiable between different FFs. Ex: for FF1 clock clock arrives early and for FF2 later   
Impact:   
Positive skew: Clock arrives later at the destination flop → can help setup but hurts hold.   
Negative skew: Clock arrives earlier at the destination flop → can help hold but hurts setup.   
 
clock Jitter: Variation in clock edge timing between clock cycles in the same FF
