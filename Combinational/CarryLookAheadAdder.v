The drawback of ‘Ripple carry adder‘ is that it has a carry propagation delay that introduces slow computation.
Since adders are used in designs like multipliers and divisions, it causes slowness in their computation. 
To tackle this issue, a carry look-ahead adder (CLA) can be used that reduces propagation delay with additional hardware complexity
